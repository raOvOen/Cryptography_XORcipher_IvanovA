# Cryptography XOR cipher 
Realization of XOR cipher algorithm by me (2021)

ATTENTION! It's advised NOT to use a symbol '_' as the password or input text to avoid collisions!

- How to encrypt?
First, you need to enter the text you want to encrypt in the top line. After that, select the key for encryption and press the 'Encrypt' button.

Similar to the encryption method. Enter the encrypted text in the top line, necessary key in the middle line and click the 'Encrypt' button. 
Order of entering keys, if there were several of them, is not important. You will get the decrypted text in the bottom line.
